# GitHub Actions for Hasura

This Action for [Hasura](https://hasura.io) enables arbitrary actions with the `hasura` cli.

## Inputs

- `args` - **Required**. This is the arguments you want to use for the `hasura` cli.

## Environment variables

- `HASURA_ENDPOINT` - **Required**. The endpoint of the Hasura GraphQL engine.

- `HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET` - **Optional**. The admin secret (if any) for the Hasura GraphQL engine.

- `HASURA_WORKDIR` - **Optional**. The path from the root of your repository to the directory where the `migrations` folder can be found.

- `HASURA_ENGINE_VERSION` - **Optional**. The version of the hasura cli you want to use. By default, it will match the version from your endpoint and fall back on `stable` if the version endpoint request fails.

```yaml

          HASURA_WORKDIR: backend/hasura # replace this by your own path if needed
